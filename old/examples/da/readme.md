# Prototype Data Analysis

## State of Affairs
* We have working text input and output.
* We have working creation of SVG and display based on data, using Haotian's function.
* Radio buttons not working, file upload not done (just hardcoded in `run.py` for now).

## Todo (Data Analysis Tab -- We Have More!)
1. Finish plumbing the other functions written by Haotian.
2. Client-side validation. 
3. Passing of server-side validation errors.
4. Aesthetic improvements.
5. Code cleanup and commenting.
