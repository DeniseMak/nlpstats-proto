## Errors:
* Why do images not display in User folder. <-- **Should work now**
* Hardcoded folder in Haotian's data analysis code
* File upload crashes if empty  <-- **Should work now**
* SVG Size
* Config upload and download, readable

## Todo:
### Jesse's
* Report score file and exported data file
* Plumb all help functions
* Yellow tab if things change
* typos
### Denise's
* Debug issue with effect size output.
* Fix missing input field for bootstrap B in significance test.
* Power Analysis: Automatically generate intelligent defaults and explain why 
* **done. Now we show error message if they haven't uploaded a file and make the submission required.** Empty upload crash
* **done. We check the cookie** check if already uploaded the score file. 
* throw format exception for bad system file
* **done** Persist the file uploaded notification after submit by using class="button" and hiding <input>
### Up for grabs
* Merge Denise and Jesse versions
* Client side file validation
* Yellow tab if things change
* Show/hide graphics button
* Highlight selected tab and grey out impossible tabs
* SVG Screenshot
* generate report zip
* Set fixed x dimension
* Patas running
* Code cleanup and review
* Make file upload required if we can see that the fileName cookie doesn't exist.
* can .button go back into CSS file? Couldn't get it to work when it was in `other.css`, so for now it's in `<style>` in `tab_interface.html`.
* clear old cookies (maybe this is done automatically)

## Questions:
* Huge headlines?
* Copy editing
* Explanatory text inline
* Edit paper
* Prepower analysis
