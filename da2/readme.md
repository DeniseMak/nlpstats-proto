# Prototype Data Analysis - V2

## State of Affairs
* We have working text input and output.
* File upload now saves the chosen file into the 'da2' directory
* We have working creation of SVG and display based on data, using Haotian's function.
* Radio buttons not working

## Todo (Data Analysis Tab -- We Have More!)
1. Refocus form on the correct tab after submission. 
2. Finish plumbing the other functions written by Haotian.
3. Client-side validation. 
4. Passing of server-side validation errors.
5. Aesthetic improvements.
6. Code cleanup and commenting.


## Resources

* Note: unlike the example in the 'da' directory the submit button for this example does not
use AJAX.

This subdirectory has my work on the project so far. A lot of it is plumbed together from the following links.
