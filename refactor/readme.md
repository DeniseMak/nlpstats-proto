# Principles

Use the following names for all references to tabs (tabs, filenames, function arguments, buttons, etc.):
* da
* esa
* rpa
* upload
* download
* ppa
* st
* welcome

Use cross-platform path names and no `os.system` that only works on Unix.

Limit lines to 80 characters in Python, and be reasonable in HTML.
